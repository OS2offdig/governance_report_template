# Getting Started

*Welcome to our OS2 project! We appreciate your interest in
contributing. This guide outlines how you can get involved and make a
positive impact.*

:unlock: **Get access!**

> Make sure all participants have github accounts and have at least run through a basic tutorial on git and github.
> 
> [Start your journey - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey)

:loudspeaker: **Request a sandbox**

> Request a sandbox repo in the os2 sandbox
> 
> Participate in setting up repository with documentation, automations, builds etc. using the os2 templates.
> 
> [OS2 Sandbox - GitHub](https://github.com/OS2sandbox/) - email: os2@os2.eu

:pencil: **Document user stories**

> Use GitHub issues to create user stories and assign individual tasks to the stories. Add labels to the issues and assign the stories and tasks to Milestones.

:mag: **Look upstream for fitting projects**

> Before your impulse to start coding sets in, reserve time and effort together with your team to research and evaluate upstream solutions. Theres probably already a viable solution out there that just needs a tweak and an upstream contribution. Reach out, discuss your suggestions with OS2 and create an [Architectural Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/) documenting your design choices.

:twisted_rightwards_arrows: **Contribute code and docs to issue branches**

> Following the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), contribute your code and docs to the documented issues by creating a branch for each issue to isolate your work and enable reviews before it is accepted into the branch that holds the user story. Create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) when your work is tested and ready for review. After acceptance testing, the Product Owner can merge the finished feature that solves the user story into the main branch. Get in touch with OS2 if there is questions about this workflow.
